    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, lets predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can look at information contained in the turnstile weather dataframe 
    at the link below:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of .40 or better.
    
    Note: due to the memory and CPU limitation of our amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are hitting 
    the 30 second  limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a smaller number
    for num_iterations if that's the case.
    
    Or if you are using your own algorithm/modesl, see if you can optimize your code so it
    runs faster.
